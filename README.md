# DSA Visualizer

## 1️⃣ Introduction

DSA Visualizer is an interactive, web-based application designed to help users learn and understand a wide range of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) through clear, step-by-step visualizations. The project covers sorting, searching, graph algorithms, dynamic programming, greedy methods, backtracking, tree operations, and mathematical algorithms. Whether you're a student or a professional, this tool provides an engaging way to see how algorithms work internally and how data is manipulated throughout the process.

## 2️⃣ Features

### Core Features

- **Interactive Visualizations:**  
  Watch algorithms in action with detailed animations that show every intermediate step of the process.
  
- **Custom Input:**  
  Users can enter their own data (e.g., custom arrays, graphs, or strings) to see how the algorithms perform on different inputs.

- **Speed Control:**  
  Adjust the animation speed using a slider and dropdown, allowing you to slow down or speed up the visualization as needed.

- **Mode Toggle (Theory/Practice):**  
  - **Theory Mode:** Displays detailed explanations, pseudocode, and example steps for each algorithm.  
  - **Practice Mode:** Provides an embedded code editor for hands-on experimentation.

- **Pause/Resume:**  
  During visualizations, use the Pause/Resume button to stop and continue the animation without resetting the current state.

### Bonus Features

- **Responsive Design:**  
  The user interface is optimized for various screen sizes and devices, ensuring a seamless experience on both desktops and mobiles.

- **Clear, Modern UI:**  
  The application features a clean and modern design with clear typography, intuitive controls, and a consistent color palette.

## 3️⃣ How to Use

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Installation:**
   - Clone the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dsa-visualizer.git
     cd dsa-visualizer
     ```
   - Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - Start the development server:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```
   - Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

2. **Navigation:**
   - Use the navigation menu to select different algorithm categories (e.g., Sorting, Searching, Graph Algorithms, etc.).
   
3. **Custom Input:**
   - For any algorithm module, you can type a custom input (like an array or graph) into the provided input fields.
   - Click the "Update" or "Random" button to refresh the visualization with your new data.

4. **Speed Control:**
   - Use the slider and dropdown to adjust the speed of the algorithm visualization.
   - This is useful for observing the algorithm in slow motion or speeding it up once you understand the process.

5. **Mode Toggle:**
   - Switch between **Theory Mode** (to view detailed pseudocode, explanation, and example steps) and **Practice Mode** (which includes an embedded online code editor for further experimentation).

6. **Pause/Resume:**
   - During any visualization, click the **Pause** button to stop the animation.
   - Click **Resume** to continue from where you left off.
   - When the algorithm completes, a final message (e.g., "Search Completed") is displayed.

## 4️⃣ Technical Details

- **Front-end Framework:**  
  [React](https://reactjs.org/) is used to build the interactive UI components.

- **Animation Library:**  
  [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) is used for smooth, production-ready animations.

- **JavaScript (ES6+):**  
  The project leverages modern JavaScript features for clarity and performance.

- **Styling:**  
  The UI uses a combination of inline CSS and external CSS (e.g., `SortingVisualizer.css`) for responsive and modern design.



## 5️⃣ Future Enhancements

- **Expanded Algorithm Library:**  
  Incorporate additional algorithms such as advanced graph algorithms, additional dynamic programming challenges, and other topics in computer science.

- **User Authentication & Progress Tracking:**  
  Allow users to create accounts, save their progress, bookmark favorite algorithms, and track their learning journey over time.

- **Enhanced Interactivity:**  
  Add features like manual step controls (Next/Previous buttons), replay options, and interactive quizzes to test understanding.

- **Mobile Optimization:**  
  Further refine the responsive design to offer an optimal experience on smartphones and tablets.

- **Community Contributions:**  
  Open the project for community contributions where users can suggest and add new algorithms, features, and improvements.
